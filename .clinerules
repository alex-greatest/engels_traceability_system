# Project Intelligence

## UI Framework
The project uses React for the user interface. All new UI components should be implemented using React.

## Database
The project uses PostgreSQL for storing component data. All data access should be implemented using Spring Data JPA.

## Table Component
For tables, use material-react-table.

## Hilla Vaadin Types
Always check the types generated by Hilla Vaadin.

## Type Consistency
Control the consistency of types between frontend and backend.

## API Client Usage
When implementing the UI for creating, editing, and deleting boiler components and their bindings, use the existing API clients in `src/main/frontend/components/api`.
